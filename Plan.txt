Add page navigation controls
Create the settings panel with basic options
Build file browser and import capability
Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements
Add animations and transitions
Implement theming system
Create bookmarking functionality
Add reading progress tracking
Implement search capability
Phase 4: Advanced Features & Optimization
Support for additional file formats
Add more customization options
Implement cloud sync capabilities
Optimize performance for various devices

Technical Considerations
Kivy Implementation Notes
Use KivyMD for material design components
Implement screen manager for navigation between views
Use RecycleView for efficient library list rendering
Create custom widgets for specialized reading controls
Implement gesture detection for touch navigation
Alternative Framework Options
BeeWare (Toga): Native UI look, but less mature for complex interfaces
Flet: Flutter-based UI framework for Python, modern but newer ecosystem
PyQt/PySide: Powerful but more complex, less optimized for mobile
Flutter + Python: Connect Flutter UI to Python backend via method channels
File Processing Strategy
Create abstraction layer for document handling
Implement file format handlers as plugins
Buffer content for smooth scrolling performance
Support incremental loading for large documents
